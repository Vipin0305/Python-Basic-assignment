What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n","  -   Python is a high level, interpreted programming language known for its readability , simplicity and versality . Python was developed by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991 . Python name is derived from British comedy show**\"Monty python's flying circuis\"** which Guido Van Rossum enjoyed . It is widely used in web development , data analysis , artificial intelligence , etc. Python is designed to be easy to write and understand making it a great choice of beginners and experienced programmers\n","\n","\n","2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n","    - In Python, an interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It translates the high-level Python code that we write (like print(\"Hello, world!\")) into low-level machine instructions that your computer can understand and run. Python is an interpreted language, which means it doesn't need to be compiled into machine code before running.The interpreter reads your code one line at a time, executes it, and moves to the next.\n","\n","3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","    - Pre-defined keywords are predefined words that holds special meaning and purpose in python . These are basically reserved words that have special meaning in the python . Some of the pre-defined keywords are ,False     class, from, or ,None ,continue ,global, True, def, if, raise ,and.\n","\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","   - No Keywords cannot be used as variable name ,if we will try to use them as variables this will cause syntax error .\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python ?\n","    - objects/container whose state or value can be changed after they are created are called as mutable objects or container . In simple words Mutability refers to whether or not an object’s value can be changed after it is created. list is a type of mutable object/supports item assignment\n","      \n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   - List are mutable because you can change them after you create them.\n","     tuples are immutable because we cannot change them after they are created.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","  -  **“==”** is Equality operator . It checks if two values are equal and looks what the object contain.\n","  “is”is Identity Operator. It Checks if two variables point to the exact same object in memory.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n","  - Logical operators are the operators that is used to combine conditional statements. In other words  Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify Boolean values (True or False).\n","\n","9.  What is type casting in Python ?\n","   - Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. It is also known as type conversion. there are two types of type casting - Implicit type casting and Explicit type casting.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","     - **Implicit**  type casting is the automatic conversion of data types by the Python interpreter during an operation. Python promotes the data type to avoid data loss, without requiring explicit instructions from the programmer.\n","      **Explicit** type casting is the process where the programmer manually converts one data type into another using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","11.  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","     -  conditional statements helps you to code decisions based on some pre-defined conditions.A conditional statement is a statement that can be evaluated to true or false.It allows us to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.\n","\n","\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work ?\n","   - **elif** means 'else if'. we use elif when we want to check more than one condition. It helps make decisions between several options in a clean and organized way.\n","\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","    - **For Loop** : it is like driving a car with automatic trannsmission  i.e you dont have to change gears automatically . it is used when know exactly how many times to run .\n","     **while loop** : while loop is used when you want to repeat until a condition becomes false .  it is like driving a car with manual transmission i.e. you have to change gears manually\n","\n","\n","14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n","     - Suppose you're writing a program that keeps asking the user to enter a password until they enter the correct one. Since you don’t know how many tries the user will need, a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","    \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"er-RZzecjzCE"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"bwHOeSryjfs4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754386070895,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":58,"user":{"displayName":"Vipin 2","userId":"16541608540248268021"}},"outputId":"46986436-9430-4bce-9411-eb4784e12d71"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}],"source":["#1.
